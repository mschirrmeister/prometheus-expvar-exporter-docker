# Examples

The 2 files `config.routedns.toml` and `config.prom-expvar-exporter.toml` are only 2 examples on how to use [prometheus-expvar-exporter](https://github.com/albertito/prometheus-expvar-exporter/tree/main) with [RouteDNS](https://github.com/folbricht/routedns).

The files are most likely not useful to you exactly as they, because you have different configuration needs. It should only give an example on how to use it.
